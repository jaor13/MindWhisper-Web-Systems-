                    <p>Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional, or psychological strain. Stress is your body's response to anything that requires attention or action. 
                        Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to your overall well-being.</p>

                    <h2>Not Just Good For The Soul</h2>
                    <p>Forgiveness is defined by replacing ill will toward an offender with goodwill. A 2023 study suggests forgiveness boosts mental health by reducing depression and anxiety levels. 
                        Other evidence suggests physical benefits as well. Studies indicate forgiveness also eases stress, improves sleep, and lowers blood pressure and heart rate. Being unable to forgive can raise blood pressure, which can affect overall heart health. 
                        Some people are innately better at forgiving, but Harvard experts say all people can learn skills that help them forgive.</p>

                    <p>Everyone goes through periods when they feel low, lethargic, or stressed. These episodes usually pass after a while, but if symptoms linger or begin to interfere with daily life, people should seek professional help. 
                        Otherwise, people can take several steps to boost their mood, such as exercising more, spending time outdoors, volunteering, meditating, and keeping a gratitude journal.</p>

            <h2>Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy – David D. Burns</h2>
            <p>The science underpinning David Burns’s Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy may no longer be cutting edge, but its core message remains a powerfully relevant one. 
                It is based on the premises of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Burns explains fundamental CBT principles clearly and convincingly, and provides numerous examples and anecdotes from his clinical practice to illustrate them. 
                Feeling Good shows us how our feelings are shaped by our thoughts. It tells us we are not our thoughts — that we can distance ourselves from negative thoughts and learn to question their validity.</p>

            <h2>The Happiness Trap: Stop Struggling, Start Living – Russ Harris</h2>
            <p>While CBT remains a powerful technique for addressing negative thoughts, we are, of course, not purely rational creatures. Sometimes, our attempts to control our thoughts can even become counterproductive. 
                In The Happiness Trap, the doctor Russ Harris explains the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) — a third-wave cognitive behavioral intervention that also integrates insights from ancient wisdom practices. 
                Harris invites us not to try to control our negative thoughts or uncomfortable feelings, nor to attempt to reason them away, but simply to de-fuse with them. 
                He suggests we accept them and then try to let them go. So-called negative thoughts, Harris argues, are a natural part of being human. If we accept that we don’t always think happy thoughts and will also experience feelings such as sadness, anger, and shame occasionally, these thoughts and feelings will come and go more naturally. 
                By stopping our attempts to try to control thoughts and feelings, we will also have more energy available to commit to value-based action.</p>
